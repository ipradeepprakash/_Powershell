eBook -PowerShell 7 Workshop - Nick Parlow

# Preface
---------
The book is split into 3 parts. 

###### Part 1
------------------ 
> we cover traditional coding theory; starting with how PowerShell works as a language, 
we look at the building blocks of the language and then move on to how we can combine them in a programmatic flow.

###### Part 2
----------------- 
> we start to put together the principles we’ve learned into scripts and modules that we can share and reuse.

###### Part 3
----------------- 
> we look at how PowerShell works in different environments, 
before finishing with a chapter on how we can access the underlying framework that PowerShell is built on.


###### Part 1: PowerShell Fundamentals
=================================
    In this part, we’ll learn about the basics of PowerShell, how the language syntax works, how we can send the results of one operation straight 
    into another with the pipeline, how PowerShell uses objects, variables, and data structures, how we can create branched and looped code, and 
    finally, how we can write to and from stored files.

        Chapter 1, Introduction to PowerShell – What It Is and How to Get It
        Chapter 2, Exploring PowerShell Cmdlets and Syntax
        Chapter 3, The PowerShell Pipeline – How to String Cmdlets Together
        Chapter 4, PowerShell Variables and Data Structures
        Chapter 5, PowerShell Control Flow – Conditionals and Loops
        Chapter 6, PowerShell and Files – Reading, Writing, and Manipulating Data
        Chapter 7, PowerShell and the Web – HTTP, REST, and JSON

###### Part 2: Scripting and Toolmaking
=====================================
    This part walks you through turning a set of cmdlets into a script, introduces functional programming, shows you how to turn scripts into modules, and how to share those modules with colleagues and others using GitHub and GitLab. It also includes a chapter on PowerShell security, so that you don’t inadvertently distribute code that is less secure than it could be.

        This part has the following chapters:

        Chapter 8, Writing Our First Script – Turning Simple Cmdlets into Reusable Code
        Chapter 9, Don’t Repeat Yourself – Functions and Scriptblocks
        Chapter 10, Error Handling – Oh No! It’s Gone Wrong!
        Chapter 11, Creating Our First Module
        Chapter 12, Securing PowerShell

###### Part 3: Using PowerShell
=====================================
    Now we understand how to use PowerShell 7, and how to write simple scripts and modules, it’s time to learn how to use it on different platforms. One of the defining features of PowerShell 7 is that it is cross-platform. This section will detail how to use PowerShell with a variety of platforms. This part has the following chapters:

    Chapter 13, Working with PowerShell 7 and Windows
    Chapter 14, PowerShell 7 for Linux and macOS
    Chapter 15, PowerShell 7 and the Raspberry Pi
    Chapter 16, Working with PowerShell and .NET
